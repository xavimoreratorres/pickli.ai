    <h2>Generated Results</h2>
    <p>The results on this page have been generated by combining Google's Generative AI Gemini with Google Cloud and an external API, <a href="https://www.movieofthenight.com/about/api" target="_blank">Streaming Availability API by Movie of the Night</a>. These technologies work together to provide you with personalized movie and show suggestions based on your preferences.</p>

    <h2>Your Data</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is very important to us. Here’s how we handle your data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Open-Text Field:</strong> We ask for your movie and show preferences via an open-text field. While we don’t collect or store any personal information (PII) directly, please avoid entering sensitive details such as your full name, ID number, or any other personal information in this field, as it’s unnecessary for the service.</li>
      <li><strong>IP Geolocation:</strong> To provide location-specific content (such as showing available streaming services in your area), we temporarily access your IP address using the third-party service <a href="https://api.ipgeolocation.io" target="_blank">ipgeolocation.io</a>. This data is used solely to determine your general location and is not stored, logged, or retained by us. Please refer to <a href="https://ipgeolocation.io/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">ipgeolocation.io’s privacy policy</a> for more details on their data handling practices.</li>
      <li><strong>Essential Session Cookies:</strong> We use essential cookies to enable basic website functionality, such as session persistence. These cookies are temporary and necessary for our website to operate correctly. They do not track any personal data and are not stored beyond your browsing session.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We rely on third-party services to provide the best possible experience for you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Cloud:</strong> We use Google Cloud and its Generative AI Gemini solely for backend processing. This service helps us generate results based on your preferences but does not access or store your personal information.</li>
      <li><strong>Streaming Availability API by Movie of the Night:</strong> This API is used to fetch movie and show availability based on your location. We do not share any personal data with this service; it only receives the titles of shows and movies to retrieve relevant availability information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Compliance with Privacy Laws</h2>
    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and comply with major privacy regulations, including the GDPR and CCPA:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>GDPR (EU):</strong> We do not collect, store, or process personal data that would require user consent under GDPR. Our essential cookies are necessary for website functionality and do not track personal information.</li>
      <li><strong>CCPA (California):</strong> We do not collect or sell any personal information. We only access transient data, such as IP addresses, for real-time functionality.</li>
    </ul>
