# Getplatforms Function

This Google Cloud Function uses the Streaming Availability API to fetch streaming platform availability for a specific movie or series title. The function incorporates exact and approximate matching to find the best result based on title, release year, and other filters. If no results are found, a fallback function is triggered to perform additional analysis.

## Functionality

The `getplatforms` function:
- Accepts a POST request with JSON data containing `title`, `country`, `releaseYear`, and `showType`.
- Queries the Streaming Availability API for matching content.
- Attempts to find an exact title match, then filters by release year or within a Â±1 year range.
- If no matches are found, it triggers a fallback function to analyze the results.
- Returns the title, release year, available streaming platforms, overview, image, and a trailer link for the best-matching result.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- Google Cloud Functions
- Axios with exponential backoff for retry mechanism
- Environment variable for the RapidAPI key (`RAPIDAPI_KEY`)

## Setup

1. **Streaming Availability API Key**:
   - Obtain an API key from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com) for the Streaming Availability API.
   - Set the key as an environment variable `RAPIDAPI_KEY` in your Google Cloud environment.

2. **Fallback Function**:
   - The function triggers a fallback API at `https://us-central1-double-voice-439307-j8.cloudfunctions.net/getplatform-fallback` if no suitable results are found.
   - Ensure that this fallback endpoint is functional and accepts the required payload structure.
