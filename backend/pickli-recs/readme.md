# Pickli-recs Function

This Google Cloud Function, `recommendMovies`, provides customized movie or series recommendations based on user preferences, platform availability, and other specified parameters. It integrates with an external recommendation API and Google Generative AI (Gemini) to analyze, score, and explain recommendations based on the user's input criteria.

## Functionality

The `recommendMovies` function:
- Accepts a POST request with JSON data that includes `prompt`, `platforms`, `country`, and `showType`.
- Uses two temperature settings (0.2 and 2) to get a range of recommendations from an external API.
- Generates a structured prompt for Gemini, which scores and ranks recommendations based on user preferences.
- Returns recommendations with detailed explanations and scores.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- Google Cloud Functions
- Axios for API requests
- Google Generative AI SDK
- Environment variable for the Gemini API key (`gemini-api`)

## Setup

1. **Google Generative AI (Gemini) API Key**:
   - Obtain an API key from [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai).
   - Set the key as an environment variable `gemini-api` in your Google Cloud environment.

2. **Allowed Origins**:
   - The function allows CORS requests from `https://pickli.ai` and `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
   - Modify the `allowedOrigins` array in the code to add or remove origins as needed.
